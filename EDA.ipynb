NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged and agreed, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: ARTICLE I THE MERGER; CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME 1.1 The Merger . Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub shall be the successor in the Merger (in such capacity, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the “ Surviving Company ”) and shall continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “ MGCL ”) and the Maryland REIT Law (the “ MRL ”). 1.2 Closing . The closing of the Merger (the “ Closing ”) shall take place (i)\\xa0remotely by the electronic exchange of documents and signatures (or their electronic counterparts), and closing deliverables, as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than three (3)\\xa0Business Days, following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of each of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (ii)\\xa0at such other place and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree in writing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “ Business Day ” shall mean any day of the year on which banks are not required or authorized by Law to close in New York City. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the “ Closing Date ”. 1.3 Effective Time . Immediately following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause the articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the “ Articles of Merger ”) to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the “ SDAT ”) as provided in the MGCL and the MRL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT or at such later time (not to exceed thirty (30)\\xa0days from the date the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT) as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing and set forth in the Articles of Merger in accordance with the MGCL and the MRL (the “ Effective Time ”). ARTICLE II ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY 2.1 The Declaration of Trust of the Surviving Company .

At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain unchanged and shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company (the “ Bylaws ”), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to Section 6.11 , except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be such name as Parent may designate. 2 ARTICLE III MANAGEMENT OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY 3.1 Management of Surviving Company . The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that that the trustee(s) and officers of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as the only trustee(s) and officers of the Surviving Company until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal in accordance with the declaration of trust and bylaws of the Surviving Company. ARTICLE IV EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES; EXCHANGE 4.1 Effect on Capital Stock . (a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: (i) Merger Consideration . Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “ Shares ” and each, a “ Share ”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Company Subsidiary (each such Share, an “ Excluded Share ” and, collectively, the “ Excluded Shares ”)) shall be converted into the right to receive $13.50 per Share in cash without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax in accordance with Section 4.2(f) (the “ Merger Consideration ”). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and (A)\\xa0each certificate (a “ Certificate ”) formerly representing any of the Shares (other than the Excluded Shares) and (B)\\xa0each book-entry account formerly representing any uncertificated Shares (“ Uncertificated Shares ”) (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. (ii) Cancellation of Excluded Shares . Subject to Section 4.3 , each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. (b) Merger Sub . Each common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share (“ Common Share ”), of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one Common Share of the Surviving Company, such that immediately following the Merger, Parent shall continue as the sole shareholder of the Surviving Company. 3 4.2 Exchange of Certificates . (a) Paying Agent . On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company’s prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (the “ Paying Agent ”), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), an aggregate amount of cash comprising the amounts required to be delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(a) in respect of Shares (such aggregate amount of cash being hereinafter referred to as the “ Exchange Fund ”). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided , that (i)\\xa0such investments shall be an obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard\\xa0& Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks (collectively, the “ Permitted Investments ”) and (ii)\\xa0no such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 4.1(a) . To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. No later than three (3)\\xa0Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the applicable terms of this Agreement. (b) Exchange Procedures . Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within four (4)\\xa0Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e) ) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e) ). Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e) ) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount by check after giving effect to any required Tax withholding provided in Section 4.2(f) equal to the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a) , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “ Person ” shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 4 (c) Transfers . From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. (d) Termination of Exchange Fund . Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve (12)\\xa0months after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parent’s option, to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any payment of cash (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f) ) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e) ), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar federal, state, local, foreign or transnational law, statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule or regulation (collectively, “ Laws ”). To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates . In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE IV (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f) ) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. (f) Withholding Rights . Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “ Code ”), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 5 (g) Uncertificated Shares . Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within four (4)\\xa0Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to (i)\\xa0mail to each holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii)\\xa0deliver the cash that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of its Shares pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f) ), without interest thereon. 4.3 No Dissenters ’ or Appraisal Rights . No dissenters’ or appraisal rights will be available with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including any remedy under Section\\xa03-201 et seq. of the MGCL. 4.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution .

Parent shall (i)\\xa0furnish to the Company all information required by the Exchange Act or applicable Law to be included in the Proxy Statement concerning it and the other Parent Parties, (ii)\\xa0provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of information to be included therein and (iii)\\xa0otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments received from the SEC.

The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 6.4 Company Stockholders Meeting . (a) The Company will, in coordination with Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene a meeting of holders of Shares to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger (the “ Company Stockholders Meeting ”). Unless the board of directors of the Company determines that it would be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable Law, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no less than thirty-five (35)\\xa0calendar days and no later than forty (40)\\xa0calendar days after (1)\\xa0the tenth calendar day after the initial preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (2)\\xa0if the SEC has, by the tenth calendar day after the initial preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2 , the Company’s board of directors shall (i)\\xa0include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii)\\xa0recommend at the Company Stockholders Meeting that the holders of Shares approve the Merger and (iii)\\xa0use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A)\\xa0it will not receive proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (B)\\xa0it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting in consultation with Parent. In addition, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a) , the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such 51 supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable under applicable Law and reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Furthermore, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a) , solely in the event Parent determines in good faith after consultation with the Company that the Company would not reasonably be expected to receive proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, then upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in which case, the Company shall, unless the board of directors of the Company has effected a Change in Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.2(f) , use its reasonable best efforts during any such adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable; provided , that Parent shall only be entitled to request such an adjournment twice and, in any event, for no more than seven (7)\\xa0days in each instance. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of the Merger shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the approval of the Merger) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without the Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable Law. (b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit the Merger to the holders of Shares for approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

None of the parties, without the other party’s prior written consent, shall enter into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from consummating the contemplated transactions).

(e) If the amount that Company would otherwise be obligated to pay to Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(b) is greater than the amount payable for the tax year during which any such amount would otherwise be paid pursuant to Section 8.6(d) (the positive excess of such amount, the “ Parent Excess Amount ”), then: (i) the Company shall place the Parent Excess Amount into an escrow account (the “ Parent Escrow Account ”) using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent, and Parent shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until Parent delivers to the Company, at the sole option of Parent, (A)\\xa0an opinion (an “ Parent Excess Amount Tax Opinion ”) of Parent’s tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would not constitute Nonqualifying Income or (B)\\xa0a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) indicating that the receipt of any Parent Excess Amount hereunder will not cause Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) to fail to satisfy the REIT Requirements (a “ Parent REIT Qualification Ruling ”). The escrow agreement shall also provide that (x)\\xa0the amount in the Parent Escrow Account shall be treated as the property of the Company, unless it is released from such Parent Escrow Account to Parent, (y)\\xa0all income earned upon the amount in the Parent Escrow Account shall be treated as income of the Company and reported, as and to the extent required by applicable Law, by the escrow agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, as income earned by the Company whether or not said income has been distributed during such tax year, and (z)\\xa0the amount in the Parent Escrow Account shall be invested in Permitted Investments only, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion; (ii) any amount held in the Parent Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 8.6 for five (5)\\xa0years shall be released from such escrow to be used as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, and Parent shall have no rights in such amounts thereafter; and (iii) Parent shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the Parent Escrow Account. 78 (f) The Company shall cooperate, at no unreimbursed cost or expense to the Company, in good faith with Parent (including amending this Section 8.6 at the reasonable request of Parent) in order to (i)\\xa0maximize the portion of the payments that may be made to Parent hereunder without causing Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) to fail to meet the REIT Requirements, (ii)\\xa0improve Parent’s (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) chances of securing a favorable Parent REIT Qualification Ruling, or (iii)\\xa0assist Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) in obtaining a favorable Parent Excess Amount Tax Opinion. Such cooperation shall include, for example, agreeing to make payments hereunder to a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of Parent (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) or an affiliate or designee of Parent.

(a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and paragraph headings or captions herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. The words “hereof”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word “or” when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the parties to this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other party, and to enforce 84 specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Section 6.5 , and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE IV ) by a decree of specific performance, in accordance with Section 9.5 of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other security therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (including Section 6.5 , and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE IV ) in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and seek money damages in accordance therewith. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement. (b) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ right to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section 9.13 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and/or seek payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Company Expenses and the Parent Burdensome Condition Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee and Company Expenses, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be entitled to both, on the one hand, a grant of specific performance and, on the other hand, payment of the Parent Termination Fee and Company Expenses.

Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2 , the Company’s board of directors shall (i)\\xa0include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii)\\xa0recommend at the Company Stockholders Meeting that the holders of Shares approve the Merger and (iii)\\xa0use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or before the date on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes that (A)\\xa0it will not receive proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, whether or not a quorum is present or (B)\\xa0it will not have enough Shares represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting in consultation with Parent. In addition, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a) , the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable Law and for such 51 supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated in a manner suitable under applicable Law and reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Furthermore, notwithstanding the first and second sentence of this Section 6.4(a) , solely in the event Parent determines in good faith after consultation with the Company that the Company would not reasonably be expected to receive proxies representing the Requisite Company Vote, then upon the written request of Parent, the Company shall adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in which case, the Company shall, unless the board of directors of the Company has effected a Change in Recommendation in compliance with Section 6.2(f) , use its reasonable best efforts during any such adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable; provided , that Parent shall only be entitled to request such an adjournment twice and, in any event, for no more than seven (7)\\xa0days in each instance. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of the Merger shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders in connection with the approval of the Merger) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following dissemination of the definitive Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the record date of the Company Stockholders Meeting be changed without the Parent’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required by applicable Law. (b) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, the Company shall nonetheless submit the Merger to the holders of Shares for approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VIII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. (c) The Company agrees that, except in the event of a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. 6.5 Filings; Other Actions; Notification and Cooperation .

None of the parties, without the other party’s prior written consent, shall enter into any timing or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to consummate the contemplated transactions (or that would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from consummating the contemplated transactions).

(a) The table of contents and the Article, Section and paragraph headings or captions herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. The words “hereof”, “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word “or” when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement.

This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and void; provided , that upon and following the Effective Time (i)\\xa0Parent and Merger Sub may collaterally assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any Debt Financing Sources and (ii)\\xa0Parent and Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder to another Parent Party; provided , further , that, in each case, (A)\\xa0no assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder and (B)\\xa0no such assignment shall affect the obligations of any Person who has committed to provide Equity Financing under any Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee. 9.13 Specific Performance . (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the obligations, undertakings, covenants or agreements of the parties to this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other party, and to enforce 84 specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Section 6.5 , and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE IV ) by a decree of specific performance, in accordance with Section 9.5 of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual harm or damages or posting a bond or other security therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement (including Section 6.5 , and including to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, including ARTICLE I and ARTICLE IV ) in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and seek money damages in accordance therewith. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement. (b) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the exercise of the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ right to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section 9.13 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and/or seek payment of the Parent Termination Fee, Company Expenses and the Parent Burdensome Condition Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee and Company Expenses, in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be entitled to both, on the one hand, a grant of specific performance and, on the other hand, payment of the Parent Termination Fee and Company Expenses.
